# Fall 2017 Agile Group Project Final
#### This group project was created to demonstrate using Git/GitHub, working in groups and simulating how a real project would work in the real world.

#### Our task for this project was to create a ride sharing app with some basic functionality.  Our goal wasn't to produce a full app but to get familar with Git/GitHub and get use to working with a team.
