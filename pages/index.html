				<h1>Why Chippewa Valley Carpool?</h1>
				<p>Chippewa Valley Carpool is locally owned and operated within the Chippewa Valley area. <br>
        Our goal is to provide a safe, affordable, and convenient method of transportation.<br>
        The way that our service is setup, you are allowed to see the poeple you would be riding with,<br>
        so if someone doesn't seem like they are compatible with you, or you don't feel comfotable<br>
        with them, you can choose not to ride with them. Also, our service uses either cash such as<br>
        a taxi service might, but you can also choose to pay online with your card, however there will<br>
        a small charge to your account to help pay for website maintinence.</p>
